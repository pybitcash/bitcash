BitCash is Python's `fastest <guide/intro.html#why-bitcash>`_
Bitcoin Cash library and was designed from the beginning to feel intuitive, be
effortless to use, and have readable source code. It is heavily inspired by
`Requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ and
`Keras <https://github.com/fchollet/keras>`_.

**bitcash is so easy to use, in fact, you can do this:**

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from bitcash import Key
    >>>
    >>> k = Key()
    >>> k.address
    'bitcoincash:qp0hamw9rpyllkmvd8047w9em3yt9fytsunyhutucx'
    >>>
    >>> k.get_balance('usd')
    '2'
    >>>
    >>> # Let's donate a dollar to CoinSpice.io
    >>> outputs = [
    >>>     ('bitcoincash:qz69e5y8yrtujhsyht7q9xq5zhu4mrklmv0ap7tq5f', 1, 'usd'),
    >>>     # you can add more recipients here
    >>> ]
    >>>
    >>> k.send(outputs)
    '6aea7b1c687d976644a430a87e34c93a8a7fd52d77c30e9cc247fc8228b749ff'
