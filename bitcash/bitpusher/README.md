# bitpusher

- [x] Broadcasts custom OP_RETURN pushdata onto the bitcoin cash blockchain
- [x] Interfaces easily with memo.cash

## TODO

### bitpusher

Add easy interface with popular industry standards and protocols such as:
- [ ] Tokenisation standards: e.g. SLP (Simple Ledger Protocol - see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GcDGiVUEa87SIEjrvM9QcCINfoBw-R7EPWzNVR4M8EI);
 - [ ] Standard registration of Token ID / Issuer ID
 - [ ] Broadcasting the SHA256 hash of important data / contracts onto the blockchain with your preference of intellectual property archive / industry standard protocol
- [ ] Support for a few special cases such as _memo.cash_ and _blockpress.org_ to allow easy access for beginner python developers to gain experience playing around with OP_RETURN-based apps.

### bitpuller (complementary counterpart)
- [ ] easy-to-use bitDB query API for python synergising well with bitpusher
- [ ] open source, google-like, block-chain search engine

### aims
Lower barriers to entry for new developers interested in bitcoin cash e.g: 
* Creating apps / tokens
* Interacting with existing apps / tokens
* Powerful searches / queries of block-chain metadata with an intuitive API.
